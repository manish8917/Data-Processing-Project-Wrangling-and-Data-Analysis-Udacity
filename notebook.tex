Sharing my wrangling efforts, I will start with data gathering. The project is well designed to teach us three ways of data gathering. And hence I could learn three modes of data gathering such as Downloading directly, downloading programmatically and Storing data using twitter APIs. Since the data was collected from three sources, three different dataframes were created . This part of wrangling was quite interesting.  
Next while assessing data, three dataframes have been used to extensively study the data and find out the discrepancies. The use of functions such as head(), info() and describe() have been used over the three dataframes to analyze the data. The discrepancies observed such as:

\hypertarget{tidiness-issues}{%
\paragraph{Tidiness Issues:}\label{tidiness-issues}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  Dog stage variables presented in four columns(doggo, floofer, pupper,
  puppo) may be properly organized and presented in one column.\\
\item
  3 data frames viz. df\_archive\_forcleaning,
  df\_image\_predictions\_forcleaning and df\_tweet\_info\_forcleaning
  can be merged and redundant columns can be dropped.

  Moving forward towards the most crucial Data Cleaning step, the
  discrepancies observed have been taken up for cleansing. The first
  step taken was to create a copy each of all the three dataframes where
  cleansing has to be done. The pointwise resolution of quality and
  tidiness issue have been stated as under:\\
  Quality Issue Point 1. Few variable columns such as
  `in\_reply\_to\_status\_id',`in\_reply\_to\_user\_id' , etc. have many
  missing values. They have been deleted using drop() function.

  Quality Issue Point 2: The rows containing non-null values for the
  retweet related columns like `retweeted\_status\_id',
  `retweeted\_status\_user\_id', `retweeted\_status\_timestamp' were
  very less. Also it appeared as irrelevant. So, I thought of removing
  them. To execute that I removed the rows containg those values first
  and then the columns.

  Tidiness Issue Point 1: Four columns for the dog stage existed which
  had quite untidy presentation. All these four columns have been
  dropped and a new column instead have been created to show the
  available information regarding the stage of dog.

  Tidiness Issue Point 2: As data were collected from three different
  sources, three different dataframes were created. These three have
  been merged and the redundant column(such as ID) created has been
  dropped to maintain tidiness and cleanliness of the data.

  Quality Issues Point 3: As part of the protocol, the missing values in
  column variable `name' is changed from `None' to `NaN' to convenience
  in performing any future research on the data.

  Quality Issue Point 4: The datatypes of numerator and denominator have
  been corrected yo have floating values.

  Quality Issue Point 5: The numerators of the rating having decimal
  values were not handled properly were also handled. The two places
  after the decimal have been tried to accommodate.

  Quality Issue Point 6: The existence of ``\&amp'' in the text column
  have been replaced by the ``\&'' which was the actual requirement.

  Quality Issue Point 7: The source contained the illegible and
  ambiguous data which made it difficult to find out the original
  source. The same has been rectified by removing url and replaced by
  legible terms. Later the datatype of url was changed to category. And
  the values of each source were counted to establish the confidence in
  data.

  Quality Issue Point 8: The datatype of ``timestamp'' and ``tweet\_id''
  were changed to datetime and string respectively based on the
  relevancy.

  Quality Issue Point 9: The issue of tweet without rating is also taken
  up. The one such entry was been deleted.

  Quality Issue Point 10. There was an entry in the name column as `0'.
  On observation of text it was found to be ``O'Malley''. The same has
  been rectified.

  Finally the clean and combined data obtained from dataframe was saved
  in a file named ``twitter\_archive\_master.csv''.
\end{enumerate}

Further, Moving towards the analyzing part, a dataframe having a copy of
relevant variables has been created to work with.\\
Since the denominator in rating is not the same constant, so the need of
taking rating ratio was felt to give a proper balance in the rating
system.\\
Finally the trends observed were displayed through plotting by three
different plots. The first one showed the ratio of rating over the time
and the second was the precise look of the first one using ylim()
function and limiting the units in Y-axis and the third one displayed
the progress of counts of retweets and favorites with passage of time.
The details of the plot can be read from the ACT Report.
